This header-only library makes it easier to write TAP tests for C++ projects.
By including the test.hpp header, one can initiate a Test object and run tests
like so:

  sg::test::Test tester(4);
  tester.pass("First test succeeds");
  tester.test(true, "Second test succeeds");
  tester.diag("Some diagnostics output");
  tester.start_block(2);
  try {
    int result = someOperationThatMightThrow();
    tester.pass("Operation didn't throw");
    tester.test(result == 1, "Result is one");
  } catch(...) {}
  tester.end_block();
